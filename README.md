# Stacks and Queues in C++

This repository contains implementations of stack and queue data structures in C++. It includes basic operations for manipulating these structures. This project is designed for those looking to understand the fundamentals of stack and queue data structures and learn how to implement them in C++.

## Features

### Stack Operations

- **push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **pop**: Remove the top element from the stack.
- **top**: Get the top element of the stack without removing it.

### Queue Operations

- **enqueue**: Add an element to the end of the queue.
- **dequeue**: Remove the front element from the queue.
- **front**: Get the front element of the queue without removing it.
- **first**: Get the first element in the queue.
- **last**: Get the last element in the queue.
  
### Utility

- **isEmpty**: Check if the stack or queue is empty.
- **size**: Get the number of elements in the stack or queue.
- **initialize**: Initialize or reset the stack or queue.
- **removeAll**: Remove all elements from the stack or queue.
- **display**: Display all elements in the stack or queue.

## Usage

Clone the repository and compile the source code using a C++ compiler. The repository includes example usage demonstrating the basic operations.
